          <b>Bumblebees (Genus: Bombus)</b><br />
          Bumblebees get their name from the noise they create when they get
          into a flower. They make the noise by moving around inside the flower
          so fast that they literally sonicate the pollen off the flower and
          onto the hairs on their body. "It's just like they are dancing," said
          Griffin. Like the honeybee, the bumblebees you see are female workers
          who groom the pollen back and into pollen baskets on their legs. They
          live in large colonies in nests they build in the ground in abandoned
          mammal holes.

          <b>Carpenter bees (Genus: Xylocopa) </b><br />Carpenter bees, like
          honeybees and bumblebees, have pollen baskets on their legs. They also
          have a black body with yellow and black dense hairs on their head and
          thorax and a bald abdomen. If you've ever had a bee swoop out of
          seemingly nowhere and hover in front of your face looking you straight
          in the eye, that's a carpenter bee. Your first thought when this
          happens may be that it's about to attack. It's not. It's just being
          territorial.

          <b>Mason bees (Genus: Osmia)</b><br />These are small, fast-flying
          bees that have the agility of a tiny fighter jet and have metallic
          colors including blue, dull green and black. They do not have pollen
          baskets on their legs. Instead, they carry pollen in hairs on the
          underside of their abdomens.
        </p>

        <p data-aos="fade-up-right">
          <img src="../Assets/bee4.jpg" alt="bee4" /><br />
          <b>Leafcutter bees (Genus: Megachile) </b><br />These bees are very
          similar to Mason bees in their nesting characteristics except that
          they use leaves to close up their nest cavities. They are black with
          white hairs covering the thorax and the bottom of the abdomen, and
          many species have large heads with massive jaws to aid in cutting off
          pieces of leaves to seal their nests. Also like mason bees, they carry
          pollen on their abdomens and are very fast flyers.

            >Blueberry bees (Habropoda laboriosa; Southeastern blueberry bee) </b
          ><br />These bees are about the size of a honeybee but have hair
          patterns and banding that give them the appearance of a small version
          of a bumblebee or a carpenter bee.<br />They get their name because
          they have evolved with native blueberries, and their bodies have
          become the perfect fit for the bell-shaped flowers on blueberry
          plants. While they are excellent pollinators for blueberries, they
          also will pollinate other plants. Blueberry bees nest in the ground,
          especially near blueberry plants, once they find them.

          <img src="../Assets/api1.jpg" alt="bee" /><br />
          <b>Apis Mellifera Mellifera</b><br />In northwestern Europe, A. m.
          mellifera was the first honey bee to become established until the
          introduction of other bee subspecies considered more suited to modern
          beekeeping, such as the Buckfast bee a breed of bee whose ancestry
          originally included the remnants of the old British black bee (a
          strain of A. m. mellifera), which became extinct due to Acarapis
          woodi, a tracheal mite.

            >Apis Mellifera Ligustica</b
          ><br />The Italian honey bee is thought to originate from the
          continental part of Italy, south of the Alps, and north of Sicily. The
          subspecies may have survived the last Ice Age in Italy.It is
          genetically a different subspecies than that from the Iberian
          peninsula and from Sicily. It is the most widely distributed of all
          honey bees, and has proven adaptable to most climates from subtropical
          to cool temperate, but it is less successful in humid tropical
          regions. It is sometimes called the Ligurian bee.

            >Apis mellifera caucasica</b
          ><br />The Caucasian honey bee originates from the high valleys of the
          Central Caucasus. Georgia is the “central homeland” for the
          subspecies, although the bees also can be found in eastern Turkey,
          Armenia and Azerbaijan.

            >Apis mellifera carnica</b
          ><br />The Carniolan honey bee is a subspecies of the western honey
          bee. The Carniolan honey bee is native to Slovenia, southern Austria,
          and parts of Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Hungary,
          Romania, and Bulgaria.

          <img src="../Assets/api5.jpg" alt="bee" /><br /><b>Buckfast</b
          ><br />The Buckfast bee is a breed of honey bee, a cross of many
          subspecies and their strains, developed by Brother Adam (born Karl
          Kehrle in 1898 in Germany), who was in charge of beekeeping from 1919
          at Buckfast Abbey in Devon in the United Kingdom. Breeding of the
          Buckfast bee is now done by breeders throughout Europe belonging to
          the Federation of European Buckfast Beekeepers.This organisation
          maintains a pedigree for Buckfast bees, originating from the time of
          Brother Adam.

            >Apis mellifera vespida (latina)</b
          ><br />This is a large group of small bees with some only a quarter of
          the size of a honeybee. They have come to be known by the common name
          of "sweat bee" because they are attracted to human perspiration. They
          are also excellent pollinators and are active into October and even
          into November.
