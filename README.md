# CICADA-puzzle
My first project ever (2019) / great sentimental value :)

entry point : index.html page -> you are supposed to find the hidden link. Clicking on it allows you to navigate to page_2
page_2 : sound.html -> if you don't know the song, you can use an app like Shazam. It is the name of the song ("Lola Montez"
                       -> and you can write it in 1 or 2 word, caps lock on or off) that will allow you to go to page_3.
page_3 : time.html -> "Fibonacci's first six meaningful moments become minutes, then hours, then days..." : you are supposed to
                       write the first 6 numbers of the Fibonacci series (meaningful = leaving aside zero) and convert the total 
                       number (of moments <=> seconds) to days, years etc. 
                       "But what are the hours and the minutes if not a mere unlimited flow of seconds" : after the first 
                       conversion, use only the number of minutes and that of hours (do not fill in the other input fields 
                       unless you want to test the converter). It is ONLY the correct number of hours and minutes 
                       that will give you the correct number of  seconds (<=> second transformation back to seconds) 
                       allowing you to navigate to page_4.
page_4: ducks.html -> you are supposed to click the ducks following the order of the colors of the rainbow (*hint*: begin with red).
                      Somewhere over the rainbow is page_5...
page_5 : bees.html -> a page where I use a small plugin for some visual effects [not great, not terrible]
                      Apis mellifera vespida is the one that doesn't really exist, so I was thinking of using its name 
                      as part of a larger puzzle (maybe use a database?).
